# Data Fetching Agent & Applications 2.0

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Data Fetching Agent** that automates the process of retrieving, cleaning, and preparing external datasets for analysis or integration into downstream applications.  

The agent is designed to work with multiple sources and supports **data validation, transformation, and application-specific workflows**. This version (2.0) enhances functionality with improved scalability, modular design, and extended use cases.

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Fetching**  
   - Connects to APIs, CSV files, or other structured/unstructured sources.  
   - Handles authentication, request scheduling, and retries for reliability.  

2. **Data Processing**  
   - Cleans and standardizes fields.  
   - Handles missing values and applies type conversion.  
   - Includes validation checks to ensure data quality.  

3. **Applications & Use Cases**  
   - Integration with analytics pipelines.  
   - Feeding clean datasets into machine learning models.  
   - Export to storage layers (databases, cloud storage, or local files).  

4. **Version 2.0 Enhancements**  
   - Modularized functions for fetching, processing, and exporting.  
   - Error handling and logging for robustness.  
   - Configurable parameters for flexible workflows.
